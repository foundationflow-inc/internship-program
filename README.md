💻 **Task**: Create a working Google Colab notebook for fine-tuning a LAVA 1.6 7B 8-bit model. Your notebook should include:

1. Setting up the Colab environment with necessary libraries
2. Loading the LAVA 1.6 7B model and quantizing it to 8-bit
3. Preparing a small dataset for fine-tuning (you can use a subset of a public dataset)
4. Implementing the fine-tuning process using PEFT techniques (e.g., LoRA) - No need to fully train the model
   
## 📝 How to Submit Your Tasks

1. Create a GitHub account if you don't have one already.
2. For each task, create a new repository with the specified name.
3. Clone the repository to your local machine.
4. Add your project files, commit changes, and push to GitHub.
5. Include a README.md file in each repository with:
   - 📄 A brief description of your project
   - 🛠️ Instructions on how to run it
   - 📋 List of dependencies
   - 🚧 Any challenges faced and how you overcame them
6. Submit the link to your repository through the internship portal.
